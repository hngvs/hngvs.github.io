### Net Info
Sundays, 1900 hrs (7:00 pm)

### Frequency
We use a GMRS repeater for communications. This means you must have a GMRS radio which supports
transmit and receive on two separate frequencies. 

#### Pre-configured
If your GMRS radio is pre-configured for GMRS repeaters, you will need to set the channel to one of the following channels.
- GMRSr18
- Channel 18r
- GMRS 4 (legacy)
